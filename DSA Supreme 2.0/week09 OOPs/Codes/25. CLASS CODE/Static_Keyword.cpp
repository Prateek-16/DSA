// üìÇ Static Keyword in Class

/*
1Ô∏è‚É£How does class work:
1. In class, this pointer points to an instance of class. but does not point to any class.
2. This pointer is a hidden variable/perimeter of a function in a class.
3. This pointer is used to avoid the conflict between two or more instances/objects of a class.

2Ô∏è‚É£Static data members:
The variable is going to share memory with all of the class instance.

Why use of static data members?
If we want to spreadout the single copy of variable of class to all instance/object of class.

-->(Iska mtlb x and y will never be different for different instance of a class)
-->(Iska mtlb hai x and y belongs to a class but does not belong to a particular instance of a class jabki both are for all instance)
