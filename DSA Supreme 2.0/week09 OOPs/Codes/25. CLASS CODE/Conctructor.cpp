// ðŸ“‚ Constructor

/*
What is constructor:
1. A constructor is a special method (Member Function) that initializes a newly created object. 
2. The constructor is automatically called when an object is created.
3. A constructor has the same name as the class name and has not return data type.
4. If we do not create any constructor then compiler add default constructor.
5. It is used to assign the value to class data members.
6. It is used to assign default value to class data members.
7. It is used when we want to assign sensible value to data members.
8. A constructor will be always public.
9. Two types of constructor: default, parameterized, and copy constructor

What is polymorphism(Briefly):
1. Many more form of one things
