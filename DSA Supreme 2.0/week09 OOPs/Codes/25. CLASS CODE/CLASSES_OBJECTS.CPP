// ðŸ“‚ Classes and objects

/*
What is Object oriented programming:
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, 
or objects, rather than functions and logic. 

What is a class:
1. Bundle of properties/states/attributes and behaviors.
2. It is a blueprint and also a user defined data type.

What is an object:
1. This is an instance of a class.
2. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behaviors.

What is access modifiers:
1. In class, states and behaviors are private by default.
2. They are used to define scope of access.
3. Access modifiers are private, public and protected.
