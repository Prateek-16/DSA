// ðŸ“‚ Abstraction (One Pillars of OOPS)
/*
What is abstraction?
Abstraction provides the ability to internal hide details, allowing for simpler representations of objects.

In short, we don't know for background implantation. Only we want to use everything.

Jeevan me agar abstarction ho to jeevan aasan ban jayega jaise
ðŸš“Car hai to usko drive karne se matlb hai only
ðŸ“±Phone hai to uska use karne se matlb hai only
Yahi to abstraction hai

Abstraction three tarke se kiya ja skta hai in C++
1. Encapsulation: 
it is a way to implement the abstraction by building of data and method.

2. Inheritance: 
its also another way to implement the abstraction by inheriting the properties and characteristics of the super or derived class.

3. Polymorphism: 
its a third way of the abstraction. In this case, we found many forms of one things.
