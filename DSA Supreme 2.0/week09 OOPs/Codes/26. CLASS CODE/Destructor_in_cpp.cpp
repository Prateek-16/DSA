// ðŸ“‚ Destructor in C++
/*
Why we need of destructor?
A destructor is called automatically when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.

It's not mandatory to write a destructor. In majority of the cases, the compiler takes care of this for you.

However, when a class contains dynamic object, it is mandatory to write a destructor function to release memory 
before the class instance is destroyed. 

This must be done to avoid memory leak.
