// ðŸ“‚ Run time polymorphism

/*
What is run time polymorphism?
It is a late binding and dynamic polymorphism.

late binding or dynamic polymorphism is a binding mechanism that occurs during runtime. 
This means that the method that is called is determined when the program is running, not when it is compiled.

Upcasting Concept: 
Parent *p = new Child();
Upcasting is using the Super/Parent class's reference or pointer to refer to a Sub/Child class's object.

Downcasting Concept:
Child *c = new Parent();
Downcasting is using the Sub/Child class's reference or pointer to refer to a Super/Parent class's object.

Function Overriding:
The process of defining a function with the same name and parameters as a function in a base class, in a derived class.

In short, A feature that allows us to use a function in the child class that is already present in its parent class.

What is virtual keyword:
1. Yeh ek late bindind karne ka tarika hai
2. Yeh ek run time par decision lene tarika hai
3. Yeh ek tarika hai function ko virtual bnane par usko compile time par seriously na le ka

Note: 
1. Virtual function can always be written in parent class.
2. Without virtual early binding, static binding
3. With virtual late binding, dynamic binding
