1. What is Binary Tree?
    ■ Binary tree is non linear data structure
    ■ Binary tree is combination of nodes
    ■ Binary tree have at most 2 node

2. Terms of binary tree
    ■ Root Node (Starting Node)
    ■ Parent Node
    ■ Child Node
    ■ Leaf Node
    ■ Ancestor Node
    ■ Level
    ■ Edge
    ■ Descendant
    ■ Neighbour
    ■ Sibling
    ■ Subtree


■ Root Node (Starting Node):
The topmost node in a binary tree.
It is the starting point for traversing the tree.

■ Parent Node:
A node in a tree that has one or more child nodes connected to it.

■ Child Node:
A node in a tree that has a parent node and can have zero or more child nodes.

■ Leaf Node:
A node in a tree that has no children, i.e., it is at the end of a branch.

■ Ancestor Node:
Any node on the path from the root node to a particular node, excluding the node itself.

■ Level:
The depth or distance of a node from the root node. The root node is at level 0.

■ Edge:
The connection or link between a parent node and a child node.

■ Descendant:
Any node on the path from a particular node to its leaves, excluding the node itself.

■ Neighbour:
Nodes that share the same parent in a binary tree.

■ Sibling:
Nodes that share the same parent in a binary tree; they are also each other's siblings.

■ Subtree:
A tree formed by a node and its descendants in a larger tree.
