// ðŸ“‚ 3: Friend Keyword

/*
1. friend is a keyword in C++ that is used to share the information of a class that was previously hidden.
2. For example, the private members of a class are hidden from every other class and cannot be modified except through getters or setters. 
Similarly, the protected members are hidden from all classes other than its children classes.
