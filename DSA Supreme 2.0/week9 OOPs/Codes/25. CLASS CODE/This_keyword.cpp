// ðŸ“‚ this pointer

/*
What is this pointer:
1. this pointer is a private data member in class
2. this pointer points to current object
3. this pointer added by compiler privately

Why use of this pointer:
whenever a local variable or parameter has the same name as a member variable, 
the 'this' pointer can be used to explicitly refer to the member variable.
